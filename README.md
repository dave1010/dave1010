### About me

I'm a principal engineer at [Passenger](https://passenger.tech/). I have a background in PHP but my work now spans everything from native mobile, AI, security and compliance.

You can read my blog at **[dave.engineer](https://dave.engineer/)**, which covers topics like cognitive science, AI, leadership and coding.
